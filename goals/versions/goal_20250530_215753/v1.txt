Develop a Linux-based network enumeration tool tailored for medium-sized networks, integrating modern CLI tools such as nmap, ffuf, and bloodhound to perform comprehensive and efficient network analysis. The tool should leverage a decision-making logic where findings from one tool (e.g., open ports or services identified by nmap) dynamically trigger subsequent tools to run, ensuring efficient resource utilization. 

The tool will feature a primarily command-line interface with enhanced functionality provided by a terminal user interface (TUI) using libraries like Textualize, offering an intuitive and interactive user experience. Additionally, a web-based interface will be developed using Flask to present key findings. This interface should focus on delivering a high-level overview of the network enumeration results, while detailed technical outputs remain accessible through the TUI.

Automation and intelligence will be incorporated to optimize tool selection and execution without overengineering, maintaining a balance between advanced functionality and practical ease of development. The tool will be designed with extensibility and modularity in mind, supporting the integration of additional CLI tools and modules in the future to accommodate evolving requirements.

Testing and validation of the toolâ€™s effectiveness and efficiency will be conducted using a combination of real-world networks and simulated environments, ensuring reliability and performance in diverse scenarios. The final product will serve as a personal, versatile, and robust network enumeration solution.
